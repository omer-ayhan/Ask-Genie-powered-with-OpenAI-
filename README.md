# Ask-Genie-powered-with-OpenAI-
A small project that I've created with OpenAI API. It simply takes inputs and returns an answer value 

# Setup
 - Before start using this project you must have an secret API key from OpenAI private beta.
 - After acquiring the secret key, create a file in `.json` format and add it into that file properly.
 - Lastly as it's shown in the `main.py` script enter the file name correctly inside `open(filename)` function
